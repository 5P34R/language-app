Without permanent internet access and without confusing paper chaos? We also asked ourselves these questions in 2015. The result is Integreat, an effective and low-threshold solution. A digital platform that provides all relevant information in several languages at the municipal level to newly arrived migrants and refugees. We started with the idea under the project name Refguide+. In the meantime, Integreat is more than just an idea and a theoretical concept. It is a digital integration platform for cities, districts and federal states that want to break down language barriers and create information transparency. The focus is on all people with a migration background â€“ regardless of whether they have been forced to come to a new country and a new culture by fleeing or have come voluntarily (keyword: labour migration/ skilled workers). Our digital solution is intended to support the integration process and also serve as a basis for further activities and measures in this environment. </p>
